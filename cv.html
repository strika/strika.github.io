<h2>Work</h2>

<p>
  <strong>March 2016 - present,
  <a href="http://hackberry.dev" target="_blank">Hackberry</a></strong>
</p>

<p>
  Co-founder of <a href="http://hackberry.dev">Hackberry</a>, where we keep Ruby
  on Rails applications clean, well oiled and ticking.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>February 2012 - March 2016, Lead engineer at Rendered Text, Novi Sad</strong>
</p>

<p>
  When I joined, Rendered Text was a Ruby on Rails oriented consultancy. I
  worked on several client projects. I quickly learned how to find my way
  around in a few years old code base.
</p>

<p>
  At the time, part of the team worked actively on
  <a href="https://semaphoreci.com" target="_blank">Semaphore</a>.
  A few months after I joined the company, Semaphore was officially launched.
  After a while, the whole team switched to Semaphore and Rendered Text became
  a product focused company.
</p>

<p>
  I had an opportunity to work on almost all parts of Semaphore's code. I
  worked on core parts, such as the subsystem that creates and schedules builds
  and deploys, the logging and metrics infrastructure, the user permissions
  layer and the system for managing
  <a href="http://video.webcamp.si/wc2016_stricevic_supercharged_feature_flags/" target="_blank">features</a>.
  I also worked on the user facing application and implemented new major
  features such as organization support and Test Boosters.
</p>

<p>
  As Rendered Text and Semaphore grew from 4 full time engineers to 18
  engineers, designers, writers and other makers, I took the role of a lead
  engineer. I supported and guided a team of 4 other engineers, held 1 on 1
  meetings and helped new team members get up to speed with our code base.
</p>

<p>
  I wrote several articles for
  <a href="https://semaphoreci.com/community/authors/strika" target="_blank">Semaphore Community</a>
  and talked about our experience developing Semaphore on a
  <a href="http://video.webcamp.si/wc2016_stricevic_supercharged_feature_flags/" target="_blank">conference</a>.
